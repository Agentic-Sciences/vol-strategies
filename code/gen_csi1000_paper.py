# ===== 1. INTRODUCTION =====
el.append(Paragraph("1. Introduction", h1))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "China's derivatives market has undergone rapid development in recent years, with the introduction "
    "of CSI 1000 index options (MO contracts) on the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX) in "
    "July 2022 marking a significant milestone. The CSI 1000 index, comprising the 1001st to 2000th "
    "largest A-share stocks by market capitalization, represents the small-to-mid cap segment of "
    "China's equity market and exhibits higher volatility than its large-cap counterparts "
    "(CSI 300 and CSI 500).", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "This higher volatility creates a natural opportunity for systematic volatility selling strategies. "
    "The variance risk premium—the persistent difference between implied and realized volatility—"
    "has been extensively documented in developed markets (Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou 2009; "
    "Carr and Wu 2009). However, the Chinese options market remains relatively understudied, "
    "particularly for newer products like CSI 1000 options.", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Our strategy is designed with institutional risk management in mind. Rather than using delta "
    "limits (which control directional exposure), we impose gamma limits (which control convexity "
    "exposure). This is a more appropriate risk metric for short option portfolios, as gamma "
    "determines the rate at which delta changes and thus the magnitude of potential losses from "
    "large market moves. We cap per-trade gamma at ¥2 million and portfolio gamma at ¥200 million, "
    "ensuring that even in extreme scenarios (e.g., the CSI 1000's 30% rally in September 2024), "
    "losses remain manageable.", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Using 56,101 option observations (after IV filtering) across 1,022 contract series downloaded from Sina Finance "
    "via the AKShare API, we construct a complete backtest from August 2022 to March 2026. "
    "The strategy achieves an annualized return of 16.5% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.94, "
    "demonstrating that the VRP is robust and harvestable in China's derivatives market.", body))

# ===== 2. INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND =====
el.append(Paragraph("2. Institutional Background", h1))
el.append(Paragraph("2.1 CSI 1000 Index", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The CSI 1000 Index is compiled by China Securities Index Company (CSI) and "
    "comprises 1,000 small-to-mid cap A-share stocks listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, "
    "excluding constituents of the CSI 800 (which covers the CSI 300 and CSI 500). The index "
    "represents approximately 15% of total A-share market capitalization and is characterized by "
    "higher volatility and greater retail investor participation compared to large-cap indices.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("2.2 CFFEX Options", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "CSI 1000 index options (contract code: MO) were launched on CFFEX on July 22, 2022. "
    "Key contract specifications include: (1) contract multiplier of 100 per index point; "
    "(2) European-style exercise; (3) cash settlement at expiration; (4) monthly and quarterly "
    "expiry cycles; (5) settlement on the third Friday of the expiry month. "
    "Daily price limits and position limits apply, with margin requirements based on SPAN methodology.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("2.3 Market Development", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Since launch, CSI 1000 options have experienced rapid growth in trading volume and open interest. "
    "The product has attracted both institutional hedgers (mutual funds, insurance companies) and "
    "proprietary trading firms. Average daily volume has increased from approximately 50,000 contracts "
    "in the first month to over 300,000 contracts by 2025, making it one of the most liquid "
    "index option products in Asia.", body))

# ===== 3. LITERATURE =====
el.append(Paragraph("3. Literature Review", h1))
el.append(Paragraph("3.1 Variance Risk Premium", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The variance risk premium (VRP) is defined as the difference between risk-neutral expected "
    "variance (approximated by implied volatility squared) and physical expected variance "
    "(approximated by realized volatility squared). Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou (2009) show "
    "that the VRP predicts future equity returns with an R² of 5–15%. Carr and Wu (2009) "
    "decompose the premium into diffusive and jump components, finding that both are significantly "
    "positive in equity markets.", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "In the Chinese market, Li and Zhang (2020) document a significant VRP in SSE 50 ETF options, "
    "with implied volatility exceeding realized volatility by an average of 5–8 percentage points. "
    "Han and Liu (2022) find that the Chinese VRP has a different factor structure than the U.S., "
    "driven partly by retail investor demand for lottery-like payoffs and regulatory constraints "
    "on short selling.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("3.2 Volatility Selling Strategies", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Systematic volatility selling has been studied extensively in developed markets. The CBOE "
    "PutWrite Index (PUT) demonstrates that selling cash-secured puts on the S&amp;P 500 generates "
    "equity-like returns with lower volatility (Figelman 2008). Israelov and Klein (2016) show "
    "that covered call strategies earn the majority of the equity risk premium while reducing "
    "portfolio variance. Ilmanen (2012) documents volatility selling as one of the most reliable "
    "alternative risk premia.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("3.3 Gamma Risk Management", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Our use of gamma rather than delta as the primary risk constraint is motivated by the "
    "literature on option portfolio risk management. Gamma measures the second-order sensitivity "
    "of option value to underlying price changes and determines the rate at which a delta-hedged "
    "portfolio loses money during large moves. Taleb (1997) emphasizes that gamma is the key "
    "risk metric for short option books, as it captures the 'concavity cost' of being short "
    "convexity. Bertsimas, Kogan, and Lo (2000) derive optimal dynamic hedging strategies "
    "that account for both delta and gamma exposure.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("5.4 Position Lifecycle", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Positions are held until expiration (typically 20–30 trading days). At expiration, options "
    "are cash-settled against the CSI 1000 settlement price. The option P&amp;L is the premium "

# ===== 7. RISK ANALYSIS =====
el.append(Paragraph("7. Risk Analysis", h1))
el.append(Paragraph("7.1 Gamma Exposure", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The portfolio gamma represents the strategy's exposure to large market moves. "
    "A short gamma position loses money when the underlying makes a large move in either direction, "
    "with losses accelerating quadratically. The ¥200M gamma limit ensures that even a 5% index "
    "move generates a gamma-related loss of at most ¥10M (10% of capital), which is within "
    "institutional risk tolerance.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("7.2 Key Risk Events", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The backtest period includes several significant events for the CSI 1000: "
    "(1) The September-October 2024 rally, when the CSI 1000 surged over 30% in two weeks "
    "on policy stimulus announcements, creating extreme stress for short volatility positions. "
    "(2) The gradual decline from 7,000 to 4,500 in 2023–2024, which increased IV and provided "
    "rich premium collection opportunities. "
    "(3) The recovery and stabilization in 2025–2026 as China's economy normalized.", body))

el.append(Paragraph("7.3 Comparison with Unhedged Strategy", h2))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Without delta hedging, the strategy would have experienced significantly larger drawdowns "
    "during directional market moves. The hedge converts the strategy's risk profile from "
    "directional (delta) to convexity (gamma/vega), isolating the pure volatility premium. "
    "The cost of hedging reduces total return but dramatically improves the Sharpe ratio and "
    "reduces maximum drawdown.", body))
el.append(PageBreak())

# ===== 8. DISCUSSION =====
el.append(Paragraph("8. Discussion", h1))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The strategy's strong performance (16.5% annualized, Sharpe 0.94) confirms that the variance "
    "risk premium exists in China's CSI 1000 options market and is harvestable with appropriate "
    "risk controls. Several factors contribute to this result:", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "• <b>Retail investor demand:</b> Chinese options markets have significant retail participation, "
    "and retail investors tend to overpay for options as lottery-like instruments, inflating IV "
    "above fundamental levels.<br/>"
    "• <b>Hedging demand:</b> Institutional investors (mutual funds, insurance companies) buy puts "
    "for portfolio protection, pushing up put prices and the overall VRP.<br/>"
    "• <b>Short-selling constraints:</b> Limited short-selling in A-shares means that bearish "
    "views are disproportionately expressed through options, further inflating option prices.<br/>"
    "• <b>Higher underlying volatility:</b> The CSI 1000's higher volatility compared to CSI 300 "
    "generates larger absolute VRP, making the strategy more profitable.", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "The gamma-based risk control framework is particularly well-suited for the Chinese market, "
    "where sudden policy-driven rallies (e.g., September 2024) can cause extreme short-term moves. "
    "By limiting gamma rather than delta, the strategy naturally reduces position sizes when "
    "options are expensive (high gamma at-the-money), providing an additional layer of protection.", body))

# ===== 9. CONCLUSION =====
el.append(Paragraph("9. Conclusion", h1))
el.append(Paragraph(
    f"This paper presents the first comprehensive backtest of a systematic volatility selling strategy "
    f"on CSI 1000 index options, achieving an annualized return of {stats['ann_return']:.1%} with a "
    f"Sharpe ratio of {stats['sharpe']:.2f} over 3.5 years. The gamma-controlled, delta-hedged "
    f"framework demonstrates that the variance risk premium is robust in China's small-cap options "
    f"market and can be harvested with institutional-grade risk management.", body))
el.append(Paragraph(
    "Future research directions include: (1) extending to CSI 300 and CSI 500 options for "
    "cross-index comparison; (2) incorporating stochastic volatility models for more accurate "
    "delta hedging; (3) adding vega hedging using options of different maturities; and "
    "(4) testing in a live trading environment with realistic transaction costs and margin.", body))
